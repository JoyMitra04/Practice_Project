Problem-08:
Provided a list where every element occurs doubled except for one. Find that single one.

Problem-09:
Some operators checks about the relationship between two values and these operators are called relational operators. Given two numerical values your job is just to find out the relationship between them
that is (i) First one is greater than the second (ii) First one is less than the second or (iii) First and
second one is equal.
Input
First line of the input file is an integer t (t < 15) which denotes how many sets of inputs are there.
Each of the next t lines contain two integers a and b (|a|, |b| < 1000000001).
Output
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators
‘>’, ‘<’ or ‘=’, which indicates the relation that is appropriate for the given two numbers.
Sample Input
3
10 20
20 10
10 10


Problem-10:
10055 Hashmat the brave warrior

Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to
fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just calculates one thing, the difference between his
soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or
not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent.
Input
The input contains two numbers in every line. These two numbers in each line denotes the number
soldiers in Hashmat’s army and his opponent’s army or vice versa. The input numbers are not greater
than 2
32. Input is terminated by ‘End of File’.
Output
For each line of input, print the difference of number of soldiers between Hashmat’s army and his
opponent’s army. Each output should be in seperate line.
Sample Input
10 12
10 14
100 200
